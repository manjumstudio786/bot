# Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

## Critical Issues Resolved (8 Issues)

### 1. SQL Injection Prevention
- **Issue**: Direct string concatenation in database queries
- **Fix**: Implemented parameterized queries with validation
- **Files**: `server.js`, `database.js`
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized database access and data manipulation

### 2. Code Injection Protection
- **Issue**: Unsafe execution of user input
- **Fix**: Added input validation and sanitization
- **Files**: `server.js`, `security-middleware.js`
- **Impact**: Prevents arbitrary code execution

### 3. Authentication Security
- **Issue**: Weak JWT validation and session management
- **Fix**: Enhanced JWT validation with algorithm specification and payload verification
- **Files**: `server.js`
- **Impact**: Prevents authentication bypass and token manipulation

### 4. File Upload Security
- **Issue**: Insufficient file validation and path traversal vulnerabilities
- **Fix**: Strict MIME type validation, secure filename generation, path traversal protection
- **Files**: `server.js`
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious file uploads and directory traversal attacks

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Issue**: Unvalidated user input leading to various injection attacks
- **Fix**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Files**: `server.js`, `security-middleware.js`
- **Impact**: Prevents XSS, injection attacks, and data corruption

### 6. Rate Limiting & DoS Protection
- **Issue**: No rate limiting allowing DoS attacks
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive rate limiting for all endpoints
- **Files**: `server.js`
- **Impact**: Prevents denial of service and brute force attacks

### 7. Socket.IO Security
- **Issue**: Unauthenticated socket connections
- **Fix**: Added JWT authentication and rate limiting for socket events
- **Files**: `server.js`
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized real-time access and socket abuse

### 8. Database Query Validation
- **Issue**: Dangerous SQL operations allowed
- **Fix**: SQL query validation and operation whitelisting
- **Files**: `database.js`
- **Impact**: Prevents dangerous database operations

### Session Security
- Enhanced JWT token validation
- Added token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Implemented login attempt tracking and lockout

### File Security
- Restricted file types to safe whitelist
- Added file size limitations
- Implemented secure file naming and storage

### Information Disclosure Prevention
- Removed sensitive data from error messages
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Implemented data sanitization in responses

## Medium Priority Issues Resolved (5+ Issues)

### Type Confusion Prevention
- Added strict type checking for all inputs
- Implemented proper data type validation
- Added parameter type enforcement

### Lazy Loading Security
- Implemented secure resource loading
- Added proper access controls for dynamic content
- Enhanced validation for dynamically loaded data

## Security Enhancements Added

- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy

### 2. Input Validation Framework
- Comprehensive validation rules
- Sanitization functions
- Type checking and format validation

### 3. Rate Limiting System
- Per-endpoint rate limiting
- IP-based tracking
- Configurable limits and windows

### 4. Audit Logging
- Security event logging
- Failed authentication tracking
- Suspicious activity monitoring

### 5. Configuration Security
- Environment variable validation
- Secure default configurations
- Production security settings

## Installation of Security Dependencies

Run the following command to install required security packages:

```bash
npm install helmet validator
```

## Environment Configuration

Update your `.env` file with the new security variables from `.env.example`:

1. Generate strong JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
2. Set appropriate CORS origins
3. Configure rate limiting settings
4. Set secure file upload limits

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Deployment:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Change JWT_SECRET to a strong, unique value
   - [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
   - [ ] Configure ALLOWED_ORIGINS for your domain
   - [ ] Set secure database credentials

2. **Security Headers**
   - [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
   - [ ] Configure CSP for your domain
   - [ ] Enable HSTS headers

3. **Database Security**
   - [ ] Use dedicated database user with minimal privileges
   - [ ] Enable database SSL/TLS
   - [ ] Regular security updates

4. **File System**
   - [ ] Set proper file permissions
   - [ ] Secure upload directory
   - [ ] Regular backup procedures

5. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Enable security logging
   - [ ] Set up intrusion detection
   - [ ] Monitor for suspicious activities

## Security Testing Recommendations

# Security & Production Checklist ✅

## ✅ SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- ✅ JWT tokens with issuer/audience validation
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- ✅ User session isolation per WhatsApp client
- ✅ Subscription-based access control
- ✅ Admin-only commands restricted to specific WhatsApp number

### 2. **Data Protection**

- ✅ Sensitive data logging sanitized (phone numbers, emails masked)
- ✅ File upload restrictions (type, size limits)
- ✅ Input sanitization for file names

### 3. **Network Security**
- ✅ CORS configured for production (restricted origins)
- ✅ Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- ✅ File upload size limits (50MB max)
- ✅ Socket.io user validation
- ✅ HTTPS-ready configuration

### 4. **Data Privacy**
- ✅ WhatsApp sessions isolated per user
- ✅ Campaign data stored per user (no cross-user access)

- ✅ Database connection pooling

## 🔒 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. **Environment Variables** (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Set these in production:
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_32_character_secret
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. **Database Security**
- Use strong database passwords
- Enable database SSL connections
- Regular database backups
- Restrict database access to application only

### 3. **Server Security**
- Deploy behind reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
- Enable HTTPS/SSL certificates
- Configure firewall rules
- Regular security updates

### 4. **File System**
- Secure uploads directory permissions
